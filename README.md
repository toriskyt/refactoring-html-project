This project involved refactoring existing code for the Horiseon marketing website, and to bring the page up to current ADA standards.

I first added alt tags to all image links so that they can be read with screen readers.

The next step was to use semantic elements to make the code easier to identify.

The initial non-semantic element <div> in the body header h1 was changed to a simple <head>.  The <span> tag was left to add a different color to the "seo" in Horiseon.

The non-semantic element <div> was also changed for the unordered list of links provided to the user.  It was replaced by the <nav> tag to define the set of navigation links.

The non-semantic element <div> was replaced for the "hero" image and the subsequent <div> was replaced with <section> tags to identify blocks of relative content.
